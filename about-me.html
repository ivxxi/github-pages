  <p>My Education</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Primary school<br>I attended St. Scholastica's Academy </li> <br>
    <li>High School<br>I went to Moi Girls' School Nairobi </li> <br>
    <li>University<br>attended the University of Nairobi for 2 years </li> <br>
  </ul>
  <p>I decided to take a class in programming because of my interest in problem solving. <br> I chose moringa as I heard of the learning system and seemed to have worked for many.<br> It also seems to be working for me as I have learnt more in a week than  <br>I learned in the second semester university as it was too theoretical. <br> Hence I am a step closer to making accomplishing my goals. <br> I also chose programming as I want to be able to make my own editing software.
